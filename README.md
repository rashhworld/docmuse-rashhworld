## Installation Guide

Follow these detailed steps to set up and run DocMuse AI on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rashhworld/docmuse-rashhworld.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd docmuse-rashhworld
```

#### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Backend Setup

Navigate to server directory:

```bash
cd ../server
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
node index
```

### Verification

1. Frontend should be running at: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Backend should be running at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Common Issues

- If ports 5173 or 3000 are already in use, the servers will attempt to use the next available port
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed before starting the servers
- Check that the API url inside `.env` file points to correctly (client directory)
